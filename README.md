# Steganography and Digital Watermarking Practicals

This repository contains all the practical experiments performed for the subject **Steganography and Digital Watermarking**.

Each experiment demonstrates concepts such as hiding data in media files, file size manipulation, steganalysis, and digital watermarking using both spatial and frequency domain techniques.

## 📚 Experiment List

| Exp. No. | Experiment Title |
|----------|------------------|
| 1️⃣ | Create a technique to conceal compressed data and hide it within another file |
| 2️⃣ | Conceal raw files (BMP, GIF, WAV) using S-Tools |
| 3️⃣ | Hide multiple files in one container using S-Tools |
| 4️⃣ | Produce discernible file size change using steganography |
| 5️⃣ | Discover and render covert messages using steganalysis |
| 6️⃣ | Apply digital watermarking to an image and audio for secure transmission |
| 7️⃣ | Decode watermark from image using DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) |
| 8️⃣ | Add a logo using spatial domain digital watermarking |
| 9️⃣ | Demonstrate content authentication using digital watermarking |
| 🔟 | Decode watermark from image using DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform) |
